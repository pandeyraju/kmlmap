Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally resign from my position as officer at Nepal Investment Mega Bank, effective January 10, 2025.

I am truly grateful for the opportunities to grow, learn, and contribute to the organization. I have had the privilege of working with a talented team and supporting the bank's goals, and I deeply appreciate the trust and support you have shown me during my tenure.

Please let me know how I can assist during the transition period to ensure a smooth handover of my responsibilities. I will do everything I can to complete ongoing tasks and help train a successor, if necessary.

Thank you again for the valuable experience and for allowing me to be part of the Nepal Investment Mega Bank team. I wish you and the entire organization continued success in the future.
